# Python Studies at NPS

Welcome to my Python Studies folder, a comprehensive collection dedicated to my journey in learning Python at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). This repository is designed to document my progress, projects, and learnings as I delve into Python programming, focusing on applications relevant to my field of study and interests.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a digital workspace and a portfolio of my Python projects and exercises. It's organized into various folders and files, each catering to different aspects of Python programming, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics like machine learning and data analysis.

### Folder Structure

- **`Basics`**: Contains notebooks and scripts covering Python fundamentals, including variables, data types, control structures, and basic algorithms.
- **`Data Analysis`**: Includes projects and exercises on analyzing datasets using libraries like pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib.
- **`Machine Learning`**: Features introductory projects on machine learning with Python, utilizing scikit-learn and other relevant libraries.
- **`Applications`**: This folder is dedicated to Python applications in specific domains of interest, showcasing how Python can be applied to solve real-world problems.
- **`Challenges`**: A compilation of coding challenges and their solutions, aimed at sharpening my problem-solving skills.

### Getting Started

To get started with exploring this repository, you might want to:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine or development environment to have a personal copy you can work on or refer to.
2. **Navigate through the folders** to explore the projects and studies. Each folder contains a separate `README.md` file with more detailed information about its contents.
3. **Run the Python notebooks and scripts** to see the code in action. You may need to install certain Python libraries depending on the project requirements.

### Prerequisites
